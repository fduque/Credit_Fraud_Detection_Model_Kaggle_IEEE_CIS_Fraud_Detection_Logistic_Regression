# Fraud_Detection_Model_Kaggle_IEEE_CIS_Fraud_Detection_Logistic_Regression
Model created based for Kaggle challenge. The target is to create a model which can explain and classify new transactions and tag what is the fraud probability.        -----Text From Kaggle-----    Categorical Features - Transaction ProductCD card1 - card6 addr1, addr2 P_emaildomain R_emaildomain M1 - M9 Categorical Features - Identity DeviceType DeviceInfo id_12 - id_38 The TransactionDT feature is a timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp).  You can read more about the data from this post by the competition host.  Files train_{transaction, identity}.csv - the training set test_{transaction, identity}.csv - the test set (you must predict the isFraud value for these observations) sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
